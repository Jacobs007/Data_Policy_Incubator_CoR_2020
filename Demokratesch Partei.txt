The DP insists on putting an end to regional restrictions that are often imposed by big
powerful interest groups. They may stipulate that products are channelled by way of
intermediaries, making a product more expensive in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg than in
it is in a neighbouring country.

It takes an hour and twenty-two minutes to travel by train from Brussels to Paris, a little over
two hours to get from Brussels to London, but three hours to travel between Brussels and
Luxembourg (if the train is on time). This continuing state of affairs represents a major handicap
for our country, and even more so for the City of Luxembourg, a European capital.

To limit the presence of polluting cars within urban centres, several European cities have
decided to prohibit vehicles that do not have a sticker certifying low emission levels. To make
the day-to-day lives of motorists easier within the EU, the DP wants to see the introduction of
a single European vignette rather than maintaining the current practice of providing a separate
certification for each urban centre.

In order to maintain the competitively of its financial centres, the European Union must
champion financial innovation. In this spirit, the DP wants a regulatory framework for new
products and services, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, crowd funding, crowd
investing, cloud banking, cryptocurrencies, cryptofunds , tokens and initial coin offerings.
However, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the DP considers that the
authorisation and supervision of the relevant service providers should remain with national
supervisory authorities.

Although in principle, public health belongs to the responsibility of each Member State, in
keeping with the concept of subsidiarity that the European Union can act to complement
national policies.
