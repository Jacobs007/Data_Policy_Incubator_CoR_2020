To take their views into account,
the European Union needs to be more
concerned with people to bring the
debate on issues to the level of
local authorities in a similar way
to the European Union CoR output.
We fully support effective international
cooperation on the environment
and in particular on climate policy field.
We consider it important to get climate
change under control and have it
the high priority of international
issues in dealing with the consequences
in the work of the institutions and
on the leaders' desk.

We support closer cooperation between
Member States in the fight against tax fraud.
We support the European Union's
active environmental and regional policy.
We believe that problems arising at
regional level in the decarbonisation
of the European economy as a result,
the EU needs to actively resolve it.
We support the idea of creating a
special fund for regions with
ecological requirements.
Mining of mineral resources
(oil shale, coal, etc.) will be cut.
Strengthening the single European
foreign policy function also requires
independent European borders increasing
the ability to defend.
