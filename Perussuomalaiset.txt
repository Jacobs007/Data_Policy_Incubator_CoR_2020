present and growing towards opposing the
concentration of power in Brussels - especially in regard to
immigration policy. In addition, smaller member states
- such as Denmark, Hungary and Austria - have become
fed-up of what they view as ‘dictation’ by the European
Commission in Brussels. These countries believe the important
questions of proportionality and local prioritisation
must be considered in future reforms of the European Union.

For example, the EU’s European External Action Service (EEAS)
costs some one billion Euros each year and would be a good
target for savings. Other examples are the European Committee
of the Regions (CoR) and the European Economic and Social
Committee (EESC) which spend annually hundreds
of millions of Euros - they should be abolished as they
only have advisory roles.

Finland must oppose the creation of any new EU
agencies. The planned European Union Employment
Agency, for example, would result in costs of 50 million
Euros per year. The Strasbourg ‘circus’ for an additional
bureaucratic EU locale must be abolished. The monthly
movement of the entire EU ‘parliamentary machine’ from
Brussels to Strasbourg is producing nothing more than
high costs (some 114 million Euros annually) and a size
able, detrimental impact on the environment.
