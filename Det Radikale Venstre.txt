The European Union was created
by the nation states and these
have continued an important
role in European cooperation.
The principle of subsidiarity
and the national and regional differences
must be respected. The European
cooperation must continue to be
based on making decisions so
close citizens as possible.

A large part of the current 
EU budget is designed for real 
principles which are ineffective 
in solving local problems. 
The regional aid is ineffective in 
getting activity started peripheral areas, 
as best documented in southern Italy. 
The collection of EU own resources 
for the budget must be simplified and 
really separate from national contributions.
